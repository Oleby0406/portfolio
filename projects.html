          <p> The goal of the project was to create a game using python that
            was completely text based. Some challenges that I overcame were
            keeping the text concise and working with the "pathing" of the game.
            Since we had many different functions for each room, and many
            different outcomes, it was important to keep the code organized
            to ensure that we do not get lost and every single room works 
            as intended. We also decided to have one interesting choice that
            we did out of pure curiosity. At one point in the game the player
            pick themselves a weapon. To ensure that this process was organized
            and easy to use, we used classes. This was a new concept to me and
            my partner so its use was risky and yet informational. At the end, 
            we ended up learning a lot and having a sucessful and working
            game. A major cause for our sucess was our teamwork. We understood
            each others' ideas and complimented our weaknesses. If I worked
            alone the project would be much less refined and interesting to play.
            Yet, there are still things that could be improved if we had more time.
            For example, the text is boring and stuck together, which makes
            it harder to read and the game overall less enjoyable.

        <p>This project is unique in its own way. This is the only
          project, so far, that I am unsatisfied with the final outcome
          of. The objective was to obtain images from a company that
          need to be altered, of course, the company didn't actually 
          send them. Then, we had to alter those images to satisfy
          customer needs, which in this project were to make the product
          more noticable and make people want to purchase it. In this
          project, I ended up doing most of the work. I made almost
          all of the code for the project while my partner focused on
          searching for designs to use. One of the main issues with the 
          project was the lack of previous knowledge on the topic. 
          While we did get some activities to become familiar with the 
          librarier and the concept, it was only enough to make a basic
          project. This is why our final images only got a logo and
          a border, without any complex changes. I am disappointed
          because I am used to attempting to go above the standards. 
          During this project, I felt helpless. Nevertheless, we did 
          complete the necessary basics for the project so rubric wise,
          it was sucessful. Yet by my standards, I still feel like we could
          have done much better.

             The goal of the project was to create a small scale vehicle that runs only
             on solar or hydrogen energy. This prototype would be used to give a recommendation to
             Tesla Motors to create a vehicle that would use these inexhaustible and renewable sources,
             which pollutes the air less and is cheaper to use. My job was to create the body
             of the vehicle, and I was the most responsible for making a final decision
             in regards to which energy source we decided to use using the data we have collected from our experiments and the general
             pros and cons of each source. An issue we had was the unorthodox shape of 
             both the solar panels and hydrogen cells, which made it challenging to attach them to the frame,
             but we ended up figuring out an optimal layout that ensures that the cells are secure
             using bolts. An interesting design decision we made was making the vehicle use 3
             wheels instead of the standard 3, because we felt like the 4th wheel was unnecessary
             and would just consume extra power without adding much stability or speed. This project
             was new for all of us, since we had little to no first hand experience in utilizing breadboards, solar
             panels and hydrogen cells. But because of our teamwork, we were able to work efficiently
             and ended up making a vehicle that had a significantly superior speed to many other
             designs, despite the challenges we faced.

          <h3>S.O.A.K Insulation</h3>
          <p class = "date">

             The goal of this project was to make an insulator that was less than 2 inches thick that was comprised of only 
             renewable materials. The two main things we focused on as a team were keeping the insulator environmentally friendly,
             but also as cheap as possible. My job was to brainstorm materials, help put the insulation together, but most importantly
             collected and interpret the data we collected. The data in this project was collected by putting two temperature sensors
             next to a source of heat, but one of the sensors was directly touching the heat source, while the other was on top of the insulator
             that was directly touching the source, which allowed us to see the impact of the insulation and how well it can trap heat.
             A conclusion we came to when brainstorming was that materials like cotton were great insulators because of their ability to trap
             air, thus stopping a portion of the heat from moving through. An issue we had was that after I interpreted our first set of data,
             our first attempt did not go as well as we thought it would. This put us in a tough place since we were already low on time. We
             decided to do a second design despite the project only being planned for one. The second design was significantly better than the initial
             and we still ended up doing all the required work for the project in time. This project was valuable not only because of the 
             new topic of heat conduction that we were unfamiliar with, but also taught a lesson in time management and improving on mistakes due to the 
             adjustment we made by creating a second design.

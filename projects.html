			<h3>Fun Facts Chatbot</h3>

          <p>  
            The goal of this project was to create a working chatbot that would ask questions and give
            prompts of its own but also respond to user input as accurately as possible. Due to the time 
            restrictions, my team was unable to implement a full natural language processing library into
            the chatbot, which meant we mostly hard coded the responses it gives. Nevertheless, the bot still 
            came out well, mostly giving reasonable responses. The most difficult part of the project was 
            considering all the common cases and writing a method to address them since we hard coded the 
            responses. It would certainly be interesting to redo the project but use an actual NLP library 
            this time and see how much better it would be.

          The goal of this project was to extend a simple simulation to incorporate more elements into it. 
          The language used was Java using an IDE called Greenfoot. Even though we had many options, my group 
          decided to improve the contagion simulation we already had rather than come up with a brand new idea. 
          There were plenty of great ideas to implement, so we felt no need to complicate the problem. The only 
          real challenges we encountered were using Greenfoot and Java. Greenfoot was new to us, and even though 
          both of us knew Java, we weren't completely confortable with it. To ensure that we finished on time, 
          we kept the ideas simple and easy to incorporate, yet they were still original and added a significant amount
          to the original simulation. It was overall a quick and enjoyable project that helped me fortify my knowledge of 
          Java and get quite practical experience of altering already existing things to improve them.

          The goal of this project was to use Java in Greenfoot to develop a game that would be educational in any 
          chosen aspect. Influenced by our current classes, my team decided to do a chemistry-related game that would 
          involve particles of different elements and demonstrating the reactions that can happen between them. One challenge 
          we faced was overcomplicating the project. Looking back at it after seeing the projects others made, it was 
          unnecessary for us to pick an idea that was so complicated and lengthy. On the other hand, I do believe that we did 
          an incredible job in creating our idea, so even though it was unnecessary we still learned a lot. This project also made me 
          realize how important teamwork (or rather lack of it) can influence a project. Some people barely contributed, which meant that those 
          who did had to do way more work than they intended to, making the project much more stressful than we initially thought 
          it would be. This project was one of the many in the year 2020 that made me change my work habits when in a team to 
          enforce stricter rules and deadlines to make sure that such incidents don't happen again, because it was certainly not 
          a pleasant experience.

          The goal of the project was to create a game using python that
          was completely text based. Some challenges that I overcame were
          keeping the text concise and working with the "pathing" of the game.
          Since we had many different functions for each room, and many
          different outcomes, it was important to keep the code organized
          to ensure that we do not get lost and every single room works 
          as intended. We also decided to have one interesting choice that
          we did out of pure curiosity. At one point in the game the player
          pick themselves a weapon. To ensure that this process was organized
          and easy to use, we used classes. This was a new concept to me and
          my partner so its use was risky and yet informational. At the end, 
          we ended up learning a lot and having a sucessful and working
          game. A major cause for our sucess was our teamwork. We understood
          each others' ideas and complimented our weaknesses. If I worked
          alone the project would be much less refined and interesting to play.
          Yet, there are still things that could be improved if we had more time.
          For example, the text is boring and stuck together, which makes
          it harder to read and the game overall less enjoyable.

          This project is unique in its own way. This is the only
          project, so far, that I am unsatisfied with the final outcome
          of. The objective was to obtain images from a company that
          need to be altered, of course, the company didn't actually 
          send them. Then, we had to alter those images to satisfy
          customer needs, which in this project were to make the product
          more noticable and make people want to purchase it. In this
          project, I ended up doing most of the work. I made almost
          all of the code for the project while my partner focused on
          searching for designs to use. One of the main issues with the 
          project was the lack of previous knowledge on the topic. 
          While we did get some activities to become familiar with the 
          librarier and the concept, it was only enough to make a basic
          project. This is why our final images only got a logo and
          a border, without any complex changes. I am disappointed
          because I am used to attempting to go above the standards. 
          During this project, I felt helpless. Nevertheless, we did 
          complete the necessary basics for the project so rubric wise,
          it was sucessful. Yet by my standards, I still feel like we could
          have done much better.

          The goal of the project was to create a small scale vehicle that runs only
          on solar or hydrogen energy. This prototype would be used to give a recommendation to
          Tesla Motors to create a vehicle that would use these inexhaustible and renewable sources,
          which pollutes the air less and is cheaper to use. My job was to create the body
          of the vehicle, and I was the most responsible for making a final decision
          in regards to which energy source we decided to use using the data we have collected from our experiments and the general
          pros and cons of each source. An issue we had was the unorthodox shape of 
          both the solar panels and hydrogen cells, which made it challenging to attach them to the frame,
          but we ended up figuring out an optimal layout that ensures that the cells are secure
          using bolts. An interesting design decision we made was making the vehicle use 3
          wheels instead of the standard 3, because we felt like the 4th wheel was unnecessary
          and would just consume extra power without adding much stability or speed. This project
          was new for all of us, since we had little to no first hand experience in utilizing breadboards, solar
          panels and hydrogen cells. But because of our teamwork, we were able to work efficiently
          and ended up making a vehicle that had a significantly superior speed to many other
          designs, despite the challenges we faced.

        <h3>S.O.A.K Insulation</h3>
        <p class = "date">

          The goal of this project was to make an insulator that was less than 2 inches thick that was comprised of only 
          renewable materials. The two main things we focused on as a team were keeping the insulator environmentally friendly,
          but also as cheap as possible. My job was to brainstorm materials, help put the insulation together, but most importantly
          collected and interpret the data we collected. The data in this project was collected by putting two temperature sensors
          next to a source of heat, but one of the sensors was directly touching the heat source, while the other was on top of the insulator
          that was directly touching the source, which allowed us to see the impact of the insulation and how well it can trap heat.
          A conclusion we came to when brainstorming was that materials like cotton were great insulators because of their ability to trap
          air, thus stopping a portion of the heat from moving through. An issue we had was that after I interpreted our first set of data,
          our first attempt did not go as well as we thought it would. This put us in a tough place since we were already low on time. We
          decided to do a second design despite the project only being planned for one. The second design was significantly better than the initial
          and we still ended up doing all the required work for the project in time. This project was valuable not only because of the 
          new topic of heat conduction that we were unfamiliar with, but also taught a lesson in time management and improving on mistakes due to the 
          adjustment we made by creating a second design.

            My name is Oleg Bychenkov and I am a student in Dublin High School in Dublin, CA.
            Technology is all around us, and plays a crucial role in advancing society.
            There have been great breakthroughs in things like artificial intelligence
            and machine learning, and I believe that there are many more to come.
            Hardware is creating the body of a machine, but the software is 
            its soul. That is why I want to become a software engineer in a
            leading company in these fields such as Google or Apple. I have already
            taken computer science based classes, and self-study programming languages
            or create small projects to practice and apply my skills.
          </p>

            My most important characteristic is being able to adapt
            and be creative when solving a problem. From my experience while working
            on school and personal projects, plans are made to be broken. If a 
            plan works perfectly first try, then the problem being solved is not 
            challenging enough. Challenges and barricades appear in every project, 
            ruining every plan. The most important thing to do is to figure out
            how to come back and adapt to the issues that arose and understand that 
            the initial plan is not set in stone. While it is a great guide, it is 
            crucial to understand when it went wrong and what to do about it.

            Currently, I am involved in the
            Hack Club which I plan to participate in all throughout high school. Hack Club is an international
            organization focused on computer science hackathons and projects.
            The main benefits that I am seeking are teamwork and leadership experiences, both
            of which are imperative to success on future projects. I also work with a friend
            on a nonprofit organization named Cohack that is focused on teaching elementary to high school 
            students various areas of coding through projects. It's a great educational experience
            for me since I get to talk to people who have much less experience in the field than me. So 
            I get valuable experience in teaching as well as debugging code. We have also already ran a full
            virtual hackathon all by ourselves which was an incredible and new experience that brought my experience 
            of problem solving to a whole new level. 
          </p>

            So far, an accomplishment in high school was the entrepreneurship project
            in a computer science class. This project has students all over the engineering pathway
            create a project that solves a problem of their choice. My group was the only freshman group
            to qualify for the second stage and we even ended up winning "Most Polished Product". This is 
            a significant accomplishment for me because it was the first project that I was able to 
            have so much freedom on in terms of teammates and the topic, so it was a fantastic experience.
            Despite our group having the disadvantage in the project due to the lack of practice and 
            time to prepare compared to upper classmen who have already done the project before and had 
            firsthand experience, we have gotten far. I also qualified for the finals of the project my 
            sophomore year, and I'm hoping we will do even better this year.

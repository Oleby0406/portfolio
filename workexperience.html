      <p>During the time I've spent in the engineering program, I have had the opportunity
        to meet multiple industry professionals who shared their experiences in the workplace.
        I also had the chance to go on field trips to various places to further enchance my knowledge
        of real life engineering applications.

        The speaker that influenced me the most was Maynard Holliday, the senior technical advisor
        to the secretary of defense. A specific project he talked about was him and his team dealing
        with the radiation created by the explosion of a plant in Chernobyl in 1986. What fascinated me the 
        most were his descriptions of his team attempting to solve the problem and the amount of attempts
        it took to finally find the solution. His team had to find a solution to nuclear radiation,
        that was not just deadly but most importantly a problem that humanity has never faced before until 
        that point. They had no experience working with radiation, no past mistakes to learn from, they were
        practically blindfolded. Yet, through teamwork and determination and plenty of failed attempts they finally 
        managed to create a robot with a camera resistant to the radiation to create an image of the inside of
        the plant, and that knowledge helped isolate and begin the repairs of the plant. The speaker really
        managed to show how tough the job of an engineer can be, especially if attempting something new and unexplored,
        as well as the importance of not giving up because there's always a solution.

        A field trip I took that I thought was a great educational experience was to the Patriots Jet Team hangar. 
        The main takeaway from that field trip was the importance of precision in engineering, which was demonstrated
        with examples of aerospace engineering. It's absolutely crucial for planes to be perfectly balanced, because any 
        imbalance will cause the plane to crash. Precision is even more important for space travel. To send a ship from
        Earth to Mars, the engineers must account for the rotation of the Earth and Mars around the Mars, as 
        well as the rotation of Mars around its axis, the speed of the ship, the trajectory created from leaving the 
        atmosphere of the Earth and many more things. Missing the launch angle by even one degree will escalate into a
        massive problem when the journey is millions of miles. The ship flying at a slightly different speed may cause it
        to land on a different part of Mars or even miss it due to the rotational speed. It really shows how important it is
        for engineers to be accurate and check their calculations multiple times because those errors always end up 
        escalating out of control.
